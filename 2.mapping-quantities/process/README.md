### #1 - Cultural Timeline and Histogram

This idea incorporated my love of film into the subject matter of nuclear weaponry. The Cold War and the prospect of nuclear war inspired a huge amount of dystopian and disaster films, as well as thrillers, science fiction, and action movies. Using IMBD's Top 20 films about nuclear war as well as few of my own additions, I envision the following for my first sketch: 

An x-axis going through the middle of the canvas, with a histogram on the bottom showing the frequency of testing grouped by bins of two years. 

Along the top of the x-axis, lines connecting to the appropriate year with a movie poster jpeg file showing each movie or TV series, as well as a caption with the name. Ironically, in my research I discovered that most of the "classics" of depictions of nuclear war in film were in the 1980's, when nuclear stockpiles were at their height, but nuclear testing had begun to decline. 

Each decade will have its own "color block" in the x-axis to differentiate the decades.

### #2 - Area & Line Chart

In this sketch, I wanted to incorporate the total amount of the nuclear stockpiles of both the USSR and USA and represent them as a stacked area chart. On a secondary y-axis, I wanted to graph as lines the total number of nuclear tests by each superpower. The time scales would be by 5 years to achieve some dramatic changes. I was thinking about making each point on the lines being graphed as containing a jpeg of each superpower's respective flag.

### #3 - Close Call Timeline

This sketch incorporates primarily information about incidents that nearly brought the US and USSR into a full nuclear exchange. There were a number of these incidents, each with their own unique history and I wanted to represent them correctly. Interestingly enough, in total number of "close" calls, most of them were initiated by the United States, although the most serious, the Cuban Missile Crisis, was technically brought on by the USSR (though only after American missiles were placed in Turkey, which caused USSR to seek to place its missiles in Cuba). 

What I want to do here is to have a vertical "timeline" - if there are no incidents, show an arrow to a box saying there were none. If there was only 1, then detail it in the "middle" text column. If there were more than 1 per decade, expand to the third text column and break the line up to provide a little detail on each. 

I want to include a "heat map" with color showing the density of "close calls" and "number of tests" from the base data set using red, to represent largest number of incidents and/or tests.
