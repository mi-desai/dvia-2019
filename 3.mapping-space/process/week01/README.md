## Week One

This assignment is an opportunity to explore another professional interest of mine - energy infrastructure. 

The Energy Information Agency (EIA) maintains and updates a number of shapefiles that should be compatible with Leaflet.

I want to use this assignment to visualize proximity to earthquakes to explore the role of unconventional oil and gas drilling into shale formations, as well as look at the risk factors earthquakes pose to other infrastructure sites (such as petroleum product terminal reserve tanks).
