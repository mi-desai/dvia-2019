### Right Twice a Day Documentation

This was one of the first clocks I made. I thought of time in a circular way, so an arc or repeating circle seemed like a good way to deal with it. Now.progress.day is mapped to the outermost ring, and successively smaller units have their own colors on the innermost ring.

I reworked this one from an example on the P5 Reference Website, and changed a few of the parameters, mostly shape. The "second" hand is the thinnest, representing the lease amount of time. It is also the longest, since you need to match it to a specific tick more often. The others are shorter and fatter.

I used a single color for the color scheme and experimented with saturation and hue as well as non-circular movement here. The hue shows how much time is mapped to each rectangle, with the shortest rectangle by width representing seconds.

With this one, I focused only on month progression, phase of the moon progression, and day progression. I wanted it to look like a solar sun dial, which I think was achieved given the simplicity of the geometry.

This clock represents only months and seasons and I used chroma.js to map a specific month to three colors per season, with autumn having autmunal reds, oranges, and browns and the others have similar color scheme. Each month's circle gets larger and larger until it reaches the final month, whereupon it restarts. The flaw here is that I wasn't able to clear the green circle before the entire cycle started over again.

This one I personally like looking at the most. Again, the idea of circular time was very crucial for me. Progress of minutes, hours, days, and seasons were mapped to the lines that rotate. The darker the hue of the line, the more time that line represents. I like the color background for this one.

I tried to map everything I possibly could onto this last clock, with progress for minutes, hours, days, and moon represented. The moon is the arcing circle in the center. Color is mapped to season. The color of all the filled shapes changes every three months. Additionally, days of the week and months of the year were mapped onto the clock using circles and sqaures respectively, and a smaller circle is drawn on each shape when their value is.

Overall, I liked map #6 and #7 the most.
