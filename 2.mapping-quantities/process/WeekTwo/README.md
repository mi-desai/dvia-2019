## Process - A Thousand Suns - Week02

Description of the contents of this folder, a prose description of your ideas for how to represent
the nuclear testing time series, and links to external data sources you'll be incorporating into
the project.

### Sketch - Film Timeline and Nuclear Test Histogram

External Data Source: I used a list from IMDB which allowed to be quickly scrape year and title of each film and TV episode. I then grabbed IMDB's movie poster so it could be placed into my visualization in code. 

In comparison to last week's sketch, I shifted the axis so that the layout is horizontal. 

I also decided to bin all the nuclear tests on the left histogram for every two years, which would allow for test occurrences to be more dense and more comparable to the number of films in a decade. I want to make this a stacked bar for all tests, so that the rough proportion of USA vs. USSR tests can be gauged, and also bring in color into the visualization. I may expand this to include all countries' tests. 

I decided to bin all the films by decade - I am not sure if binning the two datasets by different amounts will distort the data a bit, but I needed some way that I could display the full poster for each movie in the appropriate row. Primarily, this is a spacing issue. 

Additionally, I want to incorporate color in the center axis rectangle which will show the years in a way that does brighter colors for higher densities of tests, which will allow another comparison of number of films to number of nuclear tests. 

It seems like the next hurdles all relate to setting this up in code, which I haven't started on yet.
